# YouTube Skeleton Clone üé•

This is a simplified YouTube clone built as part of my Full Stack Development course. The purpose of this project is to focus on core YouTube functionality‚Äî**video uploading, processing, and viewing**‚Äîrather than building a full production system.

## üß± High-Level Flow

1. **User signs in** via Google with Firebase Auth
2. **User uploads a video**:
   - Calls a Firebase Function to get a signed URL
   - Uploads video directly to Cloud Storage using the signed URL
3. **Storage triggers a Pub/Sub event**
4. **Cloud Run workers** process the video with `ffmpeg`, generate multiple resolutions
5. Processed video is uploaded to a **public bucket**
6. Video metadata is stored in **Firestore**
7. **Frontend app** displays available videos and playback options
